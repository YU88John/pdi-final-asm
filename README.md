# Covid Data Analysis System
## Task Brief Description
The World Health Organisation (WHO) have hired you to develop a software system made up of two components, to manage and analyse COVID-19 data. <br> 
You will build two software systems. One system will allow the user to input nationsâ€™ data and store this data in a CSV file. The second system will read the data back into a 
program and perform various analyses on it. <br>

## First System 

In brief, this system requires:
- User Input for 6 values
- Data validation (e.g. non-empty values)
- Data storage (`.csv` format)

We will break down the deliverables to two task:
- Data input and alidation
- Data transform into `csv`

### `DataEntry.java`
This class serves as a coordinator for user interaction, data input, display, and CSV file writing, using modular components for different aspects of the functionality.

1. **User Input Handling:**
  - Prompts the user to enter the number of nations.
  - Creates an instance of the `UserInputHandler` class, passing a `Scanner` object to it.
  - Calls the `collectUserInput` method of the `UserInputHandler` instance, collecting details for each nation, including country name, national code, detected cases, deaths, and continent.

2. **Display Entered Data:**
  - Retrieves the entered data (country names, national codes, detected cases, deaths, continents) from the `UserInputHandler` instance.
  - Asks the user to enter a file name for the CSV file.

3. **Display Entered Data (Continued):**
  - If a valid file name is provided:
    - Displays the entered data for each nation:
      - Nation number, country name, national code, detected cases, deaths, and continent.

4. **CSV File Writing:**
  - Calls the `askFileName` method of the `CSVWriter` class to get the CSV file name.
  - Calls the `inputToCSV` method of the `CSVWriter` class, passing the entered data (country names, national codes, detected cases, deaths, continents) and the file name to write the data to a CSV file.

5. **Error Handling:**
  - Checks if the entered file name is valid (not null).
  - If the file name is invalid, prints an error message indicating that an invalid file name was provided.

6. **Resource Cleanup:**
  - Closes the `Scanner` to release system resources.

7. **Modular Structure:**
  - Utilizes the `UserInputHandler` and `CSVWriter` classes to encapsulate specific functionalities.
  - Promotes a modular structure for better code organization, readability, and maintainability.

### `UserInputHandler.java`
This class encapsulates the functionality of collecting user input for multiple nations, ensuring data integrity and validation. 
It also provides methods to retrieve the collected data for further use. The class promotes code modularity and separation of concerns.

1. **Constructor:**
    - Takes a `Scanner` object as a parameter during instantiation.
    - Initializes the `scanner` field with the provided `Scanner`.

2. **User Input Collection:**
    - Collects input for a specified number of nations.
    - Initializes arrays (`countryNames`, `nationalCodes`, `detectedCases`, `deaths`, `continents`) based on the number of nations.
    - Utilizes the `ValidityChecks` class for input validation during collection.

3. **Input Collection (Per Nation):**
    - For each nation, prompts the user to enter details using methods from `ValidityChecks`:
        - Country name (non-empty, trimmed).
        - National code (non-empty, trimmed).
        - Detected cases of COVID (positive integers only).
        - Deaths from COVID (positive integers only, not greater than detected cases).
        - Continent (validated against a predefined set: "EU", "AF", "AS", "NA", "SA", "AU", "OT").

4. **Input Validation (via ValidityChecks):**
    - Ensures that country name and national code are non-empty.
    - Ensures that detected cases and deaths are positive integers.
    - Ensures that deaths are not greater than detected cases.
    - Validates continent input against a predefined set.

5. **Data Retrieval Methods:**
    - Provides getter methods (`getCountryNames`, `getNationalCodes`, `getDetectedCases`, `getDeaths`, `getContinents`) to retrieve the collected data.

### `ValidityChecks.java`
This class provides a reusable method for validating inputs against a predefined rules. 
The `static` nature of the method allows it to be used without instantiating the class, making it convenient for validation purposes.

1. **Static Method:**
    - The methods are declared as `static`, indicating that they can be called on the class themselves without creating an instance of the class.

2. **Validate Country Name:**
    - Prompts the user to enter a country name until a valid non-empty string is provided.
    - Checks if the entered string is a valid integer; if true, prompts the user to enter a valid string for the country name.
    - Handles cases where the country name is empty.

3. **Validate National Code:**
    - Prompts the user to enter a national code until a valid non-empty string is provided.
    - Checks if the entered string is a valid integer; if true, prompts the user to enter a valid string for the national code.
    - Handles cases where the national code is empty.

4. **Validate Detected Cases:**
    - Prompts the user to enter the number of detected COVID cases until a valid positive integer is provided.

5. **Validate Deaths:**
    - Prompts the user to enter the number of deaths until a valid positive integer is provided.
    - Ensures that the number of deaths is not greater than the number of detected cases.

6. **Validate Continent:**
    - Prompts the user to enter a continent code (EU, AF, AS, NA, SA, AU, OT) until a valid continent is provided.
    - Uses the `isValidContinent` method for validation against a predefined set of valid continents.

7. **Helper Method: `isInteger()`:**
    - Checks if a given string can be parsed into an integer.
    - Used in country name and national code validation to ensure that the input is not a numeric value.


***

The second task is to write the user input into `.csv`(comma-separated values) form. This method accepts 5 values for data translation as given as a sample in the question
(`Country Name, National Code, Detected Cases, Number of Deaths, Continent - Qatar, QA, 5001, 1109, AS)`. For `PrintWriter` and `try-catch` that are used in this method, we will
need to import some packages from `java.io` package. The packages used in this system includes `File, FileNotFoundException, PrintWriter`. You can read more about the used packages
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/package-summary.html">here</a> . <br>
In Java, there are multiple ways to write input data to a `.csv` file. However, we will use `PrintWriter` (similar reason as why we create `Scanner` for inputs) in this system as
the question already mentions to use it. You can read more about `PrintWriter` <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/io/PrintWriter.html">here</a>. <br>
In our code, we will create a `PrintWriter` called `writer`. The `PrintWriter` will automatically create(if not exist) or replace the data(if exists). 
The implementation is learnt but not directly referenced from <a href="https://youtu.be/dHZaqMmQNO4?si=4JdenfOMmTbmzyNd">this video</a>.<br>

### `CSVWriter.java`
This class encapsulates methods for obtaining a CSV file name from the user and writing data to a CSV file.
It follows a static approach, allowing its methods to be called without instantiating an object of the class.

1. **File Name Input:**
    - The `askFileName` method prompts the user to enter a CSV file name.
    - Uses a `Scanner` object to get user input.
    - Consumes an extra line to prevent potential issues with reading newline characters.
    - Trims the entered file name, checks if it's empty, and returns the full file name with a `.csv` extension or `null` if the entered name is empty.

2. **CSV Data Writing:**
    - The `inputToCSV` method writes data to a CSV file.
    - Takes parameters:
        - `fullFileName`: The full path and name of the CSV file.
        - Arrays of data (`countryNames`, `nationalCodes`, `detectedCases`, `deaths`, `continents`).
    - Uses a try-with-resources statement to automatically close the `PrintWriter` after writing data to the file.
    - Writes headers and data to the CSV file based on the provided arrays.
    - Prints a confirmation message if the data is successfully written.
    - Handles a `FileNotFoundException` by printing the stack trace if some internal(e.g. filesystem, insufficient permissions) errors occur


***

*This functionality is deprecated in the latest update due to the decision of storing all the source codes under the same directory*


### ~~`copyCSVFile()` method~~
~~This is actually not included in the task description. However, I thought it would be better if the `csv` file is copied
into the Analysis directory every time the `DataEntry.java` is run, and the data is updated. In this way,
components become more dynamic and flexible. How? Imagine a scenario where the database team planned to output the `csv`
file to their working directory for some data warehouse purposes. Will you write the whole java code just to read the 
`csv` file from another directory? Absolutely, no! For such case, we can use
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/copy.html">Files.copy method</a>, together with 
<a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Path.html">Path</a>. I used JDK 17 for this project but 
if your JDK is lower than 11, please use <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/nio/file/Paths.html">Paths</a> instead.~~ <br>

~~This method is simple as it is implemented as it is according to official java documentations. <br>
Create path variables for source and destination~~
- ~~`Path source = Path.of(sourcePath);`~~ 
- ~~`Path destination = Path.of(destinationPath, "covidData.csv");`~~
 <br>

~~Copy the files using the above variables:~~ 
- ~~`Files.copy(source, destination, StandardCopyOption.REPLACE_EXISTING);`~~
<br> ~~`REPLACE_EXISTING` will replace the file if `covidData.csv` already exists in the destination directory. If you plan to add 
instead of overwriting, please use `.APPEND` instead. However, I would not recommend this for `csv` files due to formatting.~~
<br>

~~Add error handling while calling the method~~
- ~~`try {} catch(IOException e) {}`~~ <br>
~~Without error handling, if the paths are invalid, the file will not be copied as expected. Plus, we won't notice that as well.
For such situation, we will add `IOException`
in case there is READ errors or similar.~~

## Second System

Task description in brief: "Read the data from the CSV file and store it into an array of objects"
<br>
For this task, I used multiple documentations for better understanding of `BufferedReader`. However, the
logic idea is derived from this <a href="https://youtu.be/-Aud0cDh-J8?si=MGqZoiIyqLVgi2QX">YouTube video</a> and
<a href="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/how-to-read-the-data-from-a-csv-file-in-java">TutorialsPoint</a>. <br>
